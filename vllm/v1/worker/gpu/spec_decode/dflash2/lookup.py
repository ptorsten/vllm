"""Lookup-augmented block drafting (LABD).

When the tokens the model just produced already occurred earlier in this request's own
context, the continuation is sitting right there: propose *that* instead of what the model
drafter guessed. One Triton program per request finds the most recent occurrence of the
longest suffix (NMIN..NMAX tokens) of the token history and returns the tokens that
followed it.

Three things make this worth more than a drafter override:

* the proposal is not capped by the drafter's block. The drafter emits the 7 tokens it was
  trained for; a verbatim copy can be dozens of tokens long, and the lookup can fill every
  verify slot the server was launched with (`DFLASH_TOKENS`).
* a match may overlap the suffix it is matched against, so a repeating pattern ("- item"
  every line, an indent, a fence) is proposed from its own period rather than missed.
* the match length is a confidence signal, so the two proposals can be *fused* -- a long
  match takes the whole block, a short one only takes it if the drafter agrees with its
  first tokens. All-or-nothing overriding on a 6-token match loses acceptance on prose.

The proposal stays lossless: the caller rewrites the draft distribution for the overridden
positions to a point mass on the proposed token, which is a legal q for vLLM's rejection
sampler (accept probability becomes p(x), and the residual (p - q)+ is computed from the
same buffer), so the output distribution is unchanged. Greedy requests never read q at all.

Cost is one pass over the request's history (an int32 UVA tensor vLLM already maintains),
with an NMIN-token reject test before any candidate is extended.

    from the lookup (`use`), which is what the point-mass rewrite consumes.

    The two halves of the block are not the same bet, so they do not share a threshold.

    Head (`idx < draft_block`): the drafter already proposed these, so taking the lookup's
    token *replaces* a considered guess and a coincidental match is a loss. A match of at
    least `nstrong` tokens is taken on its own; a shorter one (down to `nmin`) only if the
    drafter independently proposed the same first `agree_min` tokens -- two independent
    sources agreeing, one having looked at the hidden state and the other at the text.

    Tail (`idx >= draft_block`): nobody proposed these, so anything the match supplies is
    free and the threshold drops to `nmin_tail`. The only requirement is consistency with
    the head that precedes them -- either the lookup owns the head too, or the drafter
    independently agreed with it all the way to `draft_block`. Tail positions always get a
    point mass, since nothing else wrote a draft distribution for them.

    `take_flags` says only that this request has something to put in the tail: a match at
    least `long_min` long with enough tokens left to fill the block. Whether the long block
    is worth its step time is decided by the caller's controller, from what long blocks have
    actually returned (match length is a poor predictor: a 6-token match can carry fifteen
    correct tokens and a 12-token one none)."""
